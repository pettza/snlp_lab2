The optional-silence phone sil occupies 14.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 6.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.8 hours of data, or 1.5 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,27.2,76)
