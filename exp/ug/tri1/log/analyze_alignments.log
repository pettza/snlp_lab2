The optional-silence phone sil occupies 13.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 61.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 5.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.8 hours of data, or 1.6 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 2.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,22.1,76)
